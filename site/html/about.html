            <h2>What is Green Energy?</h2>
            <div class="ourmission">
                <p>Green energy refers to energy resources that provide the most amount of environmental benefit. 
                    It is energy that can be produced using a method and from a source that causes no harm to the natural environment.   
                    Green energy is any energy type that is generated from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind or water. It often comes from renewable energy sources although there are some differences between renewable and green energy, which we will explore, below.
                    In order for something to classify as green energy, it must be a resource that doesn't produce pollution.
                    Green energy can also help mitigate climate pollution, which is why we aim to GO GREEN everywhere we can!

            <h2> 5 Main Types of Green Energy</h2>

                <img src="../photos/solarenergy.jpeg" alt="Solar Energy">
                <p> Solar energy: Solar energy is a relatively accessible resource, and people can harness solar power industrially or individually by installing solar panels on buildings and homes.</p>
            </div>

             
            <div class="mission-image">
                <img src="../photos/windenergy.png" alt="Wind Energy">
                <p>Wind power: Wind power is created using wind turbines which uses kinetic energy to channel the power of wind to create electricity.</p>  
            </div>

            <div class="mission-image">
                <img src="../photos/hydropower.jpg" alt="Hydropower">
                <p> Hydropower: Hydropower captures kinetic energy from currents flowing in streams and rivers</p>   
            </div>

                    <img src="../photos/biomassenergy.jpg" alt="Biomass Energy">
                    <p>Biomass: Biomass energy is energy that can be generated from agricultural, urban, and industrial waste</p>

                <img src="../photos/geothermalenergy.jpg" alt="Geothermal Energy">
                <p> Geothermal: Geothermal energy comes from the heat held within the fluids and rocks beneath the Earth’s crust </p>
